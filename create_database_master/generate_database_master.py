This script is to filter through the new and subsequent instrument lists
and convert it into a database format that can be sucked into the Contact instrument database

Put the sheets with the names of:

    instrument_master.xls as the master instrument.
    database_master as the file that is getting edited.

    Make sure that there are no duplicates in the spreadsheet.

    Remove anything above and below the spreadsheet.
    We only want the single header at the top and no notes or anything irrelevant at the bottom of the
